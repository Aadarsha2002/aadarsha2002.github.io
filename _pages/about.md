As a data analyst intern at Lab714, I develop software that works with proprietary IoT devices to extract, organize, and analyze data. I generate meaningful client-facing results from the data, which create significant cost savings. I use React and AWS to create user-friendly interfaces and dashboards for data visualization and interaction.

# Background

I graduated from [Ohio Wesleyan University](https://www.owu.edu/) with a BA in [Computer Science](https://www.owu.edu/academics/departments-programs/department-of-mathematics-and-computer-science/computer-science-general-major/) and [Data Analytics](https://www.owu.edu/academics/departments-programs/data-analytics-program/data-analytics-major/), and a minor in [Economics](https://www.owu.edu/academics/departments-programs/economics-and-business-department/minors/#:~:text=More%20Information-,Economics%20Minor,-Economics%20is%20a). I have a strong academic background and coursework in data science and analytics, and a deep understanding of the principles and practices in these fields. I have also applied and developed my skills and knowledge through practical [projects](https://aadarsha2002.github.io/projects/) and [experiences](https://aadarsha2002.github.io/cv/), including tutoring, grading, researching, and assistantships. I have received multiple honors and certifications for my academic and professional achievements, such as the Florence Leas Prize, the Golden Bishop Award, Mortar Board membership, and many more.

# Passions

I am passionate about using data science and analytics to tackle real-world problems. As a strong communicator and mentor, I am also committed to improving the community. I am looking for opportunities to further develop my skills and contribute to impactful and innovative solutions.
