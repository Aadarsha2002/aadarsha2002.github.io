As a data analyst intern at Lab714, I develop software that works with proprietary IoT devices to extract, organize, and analyze data. I generate meaningful client-facing results from the data, which create significant cost savings. I use React.js and AWS to create user-friendly interfaces and dashboards for data visualization and interaction.

I graduated from [Ohio Wesleyan University](https://www.owu.edu/) with a BA in Computer Science and Data Analytics, and a minor in Economics. I have a strong academic background and coursework in data science and analytics, and a deep understanding of the principles and practices in these fields. I have also applied and developed my skills and knowledge through practical projects and experiences, including tutoring, grading, researching, and serving as a student assistant. I have received multiple honors and certifications for my academic and professional achievements, such as the Florence Leas Prize, the Golden Bishop Award, Mortar Board membership, and many more.

I am passionate about using data science and analytics to tackle real-world problems. As a strong communicator and mentor, I am also committed to improving the community. I am looking for opportunities to further develop my skills and contribute to impactful and innovative solutions.
