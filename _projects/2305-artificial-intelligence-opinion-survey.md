Under the mentorship of Dr. Nicholas Dietrich, we conducted a research project on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the work of employees in four industries: education, IT/STEM, retail, and healthcare.

#### Data Collection

We collected data from 250 employees in each industry using Prolific, a crowdsourcing platform that connects researchers with participants. We used Qualtrics, an online survey platform, to create the surveys. The surveys asked employees about their opinions on AI, such as how it has improved their work efficiency, whether AI can do similar tasks to their jobs, and their overall thoughts on AI.

#### Analysis

We analyzed the data using Tableau dashboards and R. The visualizations allowed us to identify trends and common opinions.

We presented our preliminary results at the OWU Spring Science Symposium. Our results showed that AI has had a positive impact on the work of employees in all four industries. Employees reported that AI can make their work more efficient. Most reported that AI can perform most of their job functions and saves them some time and energy.
